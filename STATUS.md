# Polymarket US — Liquidity Rewards

## ✅ Last successful check: 2026-08-16 4:06 PM ET

Written by **the live monitor**, every hour. **If the timestamp above is more than ~2 hours old, something is broken.** Open /map. If that page will not load at all, the monitor is down and needs a restart from DigitalOcean.

> ⚠️ **Nothing is watching the watcher.** The 4-hourly Actions run used to stamp a ❌ here if the monitor died. No job in this repo has reached a runner since 2026-08-16 03:34 UTC — Actions minutes or the spending limit, fixable only at [billing](https://github.com/settings/billing). Until then a dead monitor looks like a timestamp that quietly stops moving, and no email arrives. The timestamp above is the check.

> ⚠️ **2028-slate pool scope is UNRESOLVED — estimates shown CONSERVATIVELY (program-wide, ~$8.33/side/day).** The exchange's program sheet says 'Daily (per event)' ($1,000 per event, ~4x more), but Aug-14 actuals fit program-wide almost exactly. If the docs are right, the gap means bait-anchored touches are collecting pools this tracker credits to us. Both readings are logged (family_day.csv); the Aug-15 payout — predictions 4x apart — decides.

# The details (how the numbers above are computed)

## 📍 Right now — your resting orders

### Estimated earning rate: ~$538.24/day (~$22.43/hour)

Rough estimate — assumes the books, pools, and your orders stay as they are, both sides keep qualifying, each pool covers its whole event/race (so it's divided across that race's open markets), and splits evenly between bid and ask. Scored with the official formula: `DiscountFactor ^ (ticks from best price) × size`, counting only orders inside the Target Size window. Earning orders first.
