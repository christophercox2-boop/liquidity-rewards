# Polymarket US — Liquidity Rewards

## ✅ Last successful check: 2026-08-17 6:38 AM ET

Written by **the live monitor**, every hour. **If the timestamp above is more than ~2 hours old, something is broken.** Open /map. If that page will not load at all, the monitor is down and needs a restart from DigitalOcean.

> ⚠️ **Nothing is watching the watcher.** The 4-hourly Actions run used to stamp a ❌ here if the monitor died. No job in this repo has reached a runner since 2026-08-16 03:34 UTC — Actions minutes or the spending limit, fixable only at [billing](https://github.com/settings/billing). Until then a dead monitor looks like a timestamp that quietly stops moving, and no email arrives. The timestamp above is the check.

> ✅ **2028-slate pool scope: SETTLED — the pool is per EVENT.** The Aug-15 payout decided it. Predicted program-wide vs per-event vs what actually paid: nominees $108 / $400 / **$684**, winners $140 / $310 / **$412**, the party pair $4 / $130 / **$148**. Program-wide was out by up to 34x; per-event lands within 1.1–1.7x and errs low. Estimates from 2026-08-17 use per event, so slate figures here are ~4x higher than in earlier runs — that is the fix, not a windfall.

# The details (how the numbers above are computed)

## 📍 Right now — your resting orders

### Estimated earning rate: ~$887.62/day (~$36.98/hour)

Rough estimate — assumes the books, pools, and your orders stay as they are, both sides keep qualifying, each pool covers its whole event/race (so it's divided across that race's open markets), and splits evenly between bid and ask. Scored with the official formula: `DiscountFactor ^ (ticks from best price) × size`, counting only orders inside the Target Size window. Earning orders first.
